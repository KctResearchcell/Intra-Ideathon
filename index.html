            <p>An Ideathon is an event where individuals come together to collaborate on an idea in an intensive manner over a short period of time, usually 24 to 48 hours. The teams are expected to create design plans to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges across a series of reviews and are evaluated based on how well they respond to the feedback they receive. Participants usually have a specific theme to work on and are encouraged to take a deep dive into the problems they choose to take up.

              <h4>PS-23: Ear Electronic Device for Tinnitus Frequency Identification and Relief</h4>
              <p>Tinnitus, marked by persistent ringing or buzzing in the ears, affects millions of individuals and poses a significant challenge to quality of life. The condition varies greatly between individuals, with each person experiencing different tinnitus frequencies and severity levels. Current treatment options, such as generic white noise machines or sound therapy, often fail to provide adequate relief due to their inability to target specific tinnitus frequencies. There is a critical need for a device capable of identifying the precise tinnitus frequency and adjusting therapeutic output dynamically to deliver effective, personalized relief for patients.</p>

              <h4>PS-24: Technology-Powered Flood Management for Faster Response and Recovery</h4>
              <p>Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, leading to significant loss of life, displacement, and damage to infrastructure. Despite advances in disaster management, flood response often faces critical challenges such as insufficient early warning systems, delayed coordination among agencies, and ineffective resource distribution. These issues result in prolonged recovery times and increased economic losses. The need for real-time data, efficient communication, and coordinated action is critical to mitigate the devastating impacts of floods and ensure timely and effective disaster management.</p>
